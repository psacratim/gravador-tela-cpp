NOT FINISHED!
This screen recorder is just an experiment I did to see how it would work to create a recorder using DirectX 11, ImGui, Media Foundation and Window Desktop Duplication. It's not ready for use!

Errors:
1. memory not managed: The recorder stores all the capture in memory, increasing consumption more and more without managing it.

2. The cursor is not being captured.

3. There may be more errors, I'm not really working on the project anymore.
